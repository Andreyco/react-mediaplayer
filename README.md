UNDER DEVELOPMENT, EARLY ALPHA
===============================

Please, give me a time to deliver proper solution.

* [ ] Custom controls in fullscreen mode
* [ ] Playback speed
* [ ] subtitles?
* [ ] seek
* [ ] playlist
* [ ] progress
* [ ] providers (youtube/vimeo)
* [ ] Create subscriber to context!!!
* [ ] Preserve settings (volume, ...) in storage (probably localStorage)
* [ ] Showing fallback content when no source could be decoded
* [ ] Add support for as much attributes as possible (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#Attributes)
* [ ] "source" prop in multiple formats (make it as flexible, as pissible)
